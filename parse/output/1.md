Justina Chua is an advocate for gender equality in tech and a junior at Vernon Hills High School near Chicago, Illinois. She founded HAX to make computer science more accessible and inclusive for girls and underrepresented minorities after facing discrimination as one of the few girls—if not, the only girl—in CS classes, competitions, and activities. At HAX, she directs all HAX operations and leads the HAX Executive Team. Outside of HAX, she serves as President of CS Club at school and is heavily involved in all-female CS communities as a Stanford she++ Fellow, NCWIT Awardee, and #BUILTBYGIRLS Advisee. In her free time, she enjoys going on boba runs with friends, watching Netflix shows, and reading up on psychology and tech.
