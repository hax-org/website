At HAX, she directs all HAX operations and leads the HAX Executive Team. Outside of HAX, she serves as President of CS Club at school and is heavily involved in all-female CS communities as a Stanford she++ Fellow, NCWIT Awardee, and #BUILTBYGIRLS Advisee. In her free time, she enjoys going on boba runs with friends, watching Netflix shows, and reading up on psychology and tech."
