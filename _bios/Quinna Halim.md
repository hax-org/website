order: 11
name: Quinna Halim
position: Director of Content Creation
description: "Quinna Halim is a senior at Northville High School in Michigan. At HAX, she is co-director of the Content Creation Team, where she oversees creation of guides and other HAXathon materials, along with serving as a member of Outreach. She is passionate about wielding tech for social good and hopes to explore her interests in computer science, urban planning, and entrepreneurship to create the future of mobility and explore new ways to connect physical/digital communities. Outside of HAX, you can find her writing for publications, nerding out over public transit and travel guides, crying over code, and obsessing over milk alternatives (not necessarily in that order)."
