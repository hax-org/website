order: 9
name: Isabel Abonitalla
position: Director of Design, Member of Management
description: "Isa is a bioinformatics and computer science student in Hunter College, NY. She believes in providing accessible STEM education, especially to under-served women and minorities. One day, she hopes to see more WOC in the tech industry and positions of power because they didn't experience the discrimination and lack of representation that she had gone through herself--because being one of only a handful women in upper level classes or hackathons can be quite discouraging! At HAX, she leads the design team in maintaining the branding and providing and improving upon content and other documentation; she also supports the management team in delegating tasks, organizing long-term goals, and coordinating the members throughout HAX. In her free time, she actively participates in her campus' clubs and student government, enjoys binge-watching TV shows and consuming too much fast food."
